# URC

This repository contains the implementation and specifications for the Universal Reference Calculus (URC). It is an indexed component of the Vasquez research ecosystem.

## Overview
The `URC` module provides the formal mathematical and computational framework for the Universal Reference Calculus, serving as a high-level operational layer within the Universal Reference Frame (URF) environment.

## Canonical Registry
This repository is a registered module of the Vasquez Index. Stable references, archival DOIs, and reproducibility links are maintained at:
* [Vasquez Index Dashboard](https://inaciovasquez2020.github.io/vasquez-index/dashboard.html)

## Repository Status
* **Repository Handle:** inaciovasquez2020/URC
* **Stability:** Refer to the Vasquez Index for the latest stable DOI and version history.
* **Infrastructure:** [scientific-infrastructure](https://github.com/inaciovasquez2020/scientific-infrastructure)

---

## Technical Notes
* **Integration:** The URC framework is designed to operate in conjunction with `urf-core` and the `urc-minimal-blockchain`.
* **Reproducibility:** To ensure consistent computational results, utilize the environment configurations defined in the `scientific-infrastructure` module.
* **Scope:** This repository focuses on the formal calculus and logic structures of the URC system.
